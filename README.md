# Python-Simple-Bank-Account-Management-System
The aim of this project was to create a bank account management system using classes and decorators. I had to implement a class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. This was just a mandatory project for ''MEK3100 Avansert Python-programmering for Ingeniører''
